Exploration and benchmarking performed on Apache Cassandra and DynamoDB. I have used YCSB for benchmarking with 1000k and 100k records for Cassandra. 

● Analysis on AWS DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra.

● Analyzed and benchmarked query performance using Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark utility.

● Collected query performance and compared performance matrix from 100,000 and 1,000,000 line datasets.

● Compared how different size data affects run time, throughput and average latency of a NoSQL DB.
